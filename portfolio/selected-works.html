                Chamber of Fears is a psychological single-player PC game where the objective is to move past all 5 levels of phobia to get over your fears. Each level gets increasingly eerie and challenging. This game is essentially a test of your courage, resilience, and reflexes. The final level surrounds the theme of humanity’s inevitable mortality.

                Built for PC and VR.

                Growing up in the 2000s, beloved American television shows such as Teletubbies and Spongebob SquarePants played an immense role in our childhood. What if we had the ability to enter these shows? Upon entering the show, you face a sinister twist: the once-charming characters have turned malevolent in an alternate reality. Armed with the "happy gun," you battle to reverse the decay that has infected your childhood icons while questioning the blurred lines between reality and illusion. 
                Grow Up serves as a poignant reminder that innocence inevitably fades, prompting players to reconcile nostalgia with maturity as they confront the darkness lurking beneath the surface of their cherished memories.

                Jean-Michel Basquiat was a New York City artist who started out with street art graffiti and transitioned into painting in the late 1970s to 1980s. His art style is very expressive and raw, and he often uses recurring symbols to represent themes in his work and to express his feelings about society. His graffiti tag “SAMO”, short for “same old”, was created by both him and his friend Al Diaz; this tag was to emphasize the idea of rejecting traditional values and norms of society and the art world. Basquiat’s work most often consists of vibrant colors, bold lines, text and imagery; he discusses the issues of race, inequality, power dynamics, and more through his paintings. 

                Our concept for this project was to adequately display and add onto Basquiat’s abstract graffiti art style and honor him as an influential artist through projection mapping, and using both 3D and 2D elements. For the 3D aspect of the project, we decided to use a poster board as the base of the projection, to recreate the rectangular canvas he often used for paintings. Objects-wise, we looked into the recurring symbols seen in his art, which include the crowns, anatomy elements like skeletons (bones, skulls), and the iconic dinosaur. We made origami crowns in various sizes, bought a disassembled skeleton for the bones and skull, a wooden dinosaur that we painted white, and picture frames. Our final product was almost exactly similar to the blueprint we made in our midterm project proposal. Our vision for the picture frames was to have one of them show images and self-portraits of Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the other frame was to show images of New York City in the 1980s.

                Our concept is to display the change of seasons in an immersive and interactive way using 3D and 2D elements such as a small scale tree and fake flowers to bring the scene to life. This way the audience can experience the growth and transition between the 4 seasons and be able to control what they see through interacting with pressure sensors.

                The concept of “Battle of the Card Bots” is a two-player robot fight inside an arena, where each robot is user controlled through the joysticks. The primary objective of the game is to maneuver the bots and use the needle attached to its front to pop the opponent’s balloon (clipped on the back of each bot). The first bot to pop their opponent’s balloon wins the game! As they are called “card bots,” the theme is relative to the deck of cards, with colors of black and red being the overarching theme. The red robot is “club” while the black robot is “spade,” each have engravings of their card symbol on the back of their heads. To kickstart the entire game, the users refer to the Processing sketch where they navigate through a start page, instruction page, countdown screen, and playtime screen; depending on the result of the game once the 80 second playtime timer ends, there is a game over screen, and 3 corresponding screens (tie, spade wins, club wins). The countdown is 10 seconds, in which the users can test out the joystick controls of their respective robot, and each playtime round only lasts 80 seconds! The color of the LED strip inside of the arena will also fluctuate depending on which processing screen the users are looking at.
